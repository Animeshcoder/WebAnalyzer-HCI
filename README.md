## Introduction
The **WebAnalyzer** platform is designed to offer comprehensive website optimization and analysis tools at an affordable price. Our goal is to help small businesses enhance their digital presence without the complexity or cost associated with existing platforms.

### What is WebAnalyzer?
WebAnalyzer is a user-friendly, cost-effective platform that enables small businesses to analyze and optimize their websites. It integrates multiple tools to assess website performance, security, SEO, design, and marketing effectiveness.

### Why Build WebAnalyzer?
The market for SEO and website optimization tools is dominated by expensive, complex platforms that small businesses find difficult to use. WebAnalyzer fills this gap with an accessible, intuitive solution.

---

## Context

### Background
The market for SEO and website optimization tools is saturated with high-priced platforms that are often too complex for small businesses to navigate. This creates a barrier for small businesses to effectively optimize their websites and compete in the digital space.

### Relevance
WebAnalyzer aims to bridge this gap by providing an affordable, user-friendly solution that empowers small businesses to optimize their websites without extensive technical knowledge.

---

## Goal
Our goal is to deploy the WebAnalyzer platform with all planned features, ensuring the website quality aligns with these features. Users will experience firsthand that the platform‚Äôs features are effective and actively followed by the platform itself.

---

## Problems
1. **Limited Expertise**: Team members have foundational knowledge but require further expertise. We are committed to continuous learning.
2. **Dependency on External Services**: Some features rely on external APIs. Cost or integration issues will be evaluated carefully.
3. **Innovative Features**: Groundbreaking features lack established solutions, requiring custom algorithm development.
